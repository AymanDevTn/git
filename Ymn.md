# 🚀 AymanDev Project Log

Comprehensive log of all steps, modifications, and Git operations performed during this session.

---

## 🏗️ Project Initialization
- [x] **File Creation**: Created `index.html`, `index.py`, and `readme.txt`.
- [x] **Premium Design**: Initially implemented a modern, responsive landing page using CSS gradients, glassmorphism, and animations.
- [x] **Python Scripting**: Created a basic initialization script (`index.py`) showing project status.

## ⚙️ Advanced HTML/Python Integration
- [x] **Dashboard Simplification**: Refactored `index.html` into a clean, professional "Project Control Panel".
- [x] **Output Injection**: Added a dedicated section to display the text output from the Python script.
- [x] **Source Code View**: Integrated a syntax-highlighted (mimicked via CSS) section to display the actual Python source code of `index.py` within the browser.
- [x] **Post-HotFix Dashboard**: Added a red-bordered status section to highlight changes made after the hotfix process.
